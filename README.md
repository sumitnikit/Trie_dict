# Trie_dict

A dictionary is a collection of words on a particular subject, the items of which are typically arranged in an order such that we can refer them easily and qucikly.
In this project we have applied different data structures to support dictionary functions like auto suggestion , auto completion , insertion etc 

A list of fuctions supported by our dictionary:  

1. Insertion (You can insert words of your liking)  Auto complete (After typing a few words the program will show suggestions ) 

2. Auto suggestion (Identifies potential words for mispelled entries)  

3. Most frequently searched words (Keeps tract of the words which are used most frequently)  

4. Most recently searched queries (Keeps track of the words which were searched recently (Like showing history))  


Optimised the process by using STL library structures and functions and using self created data structure like trie.
